            <h2>Failure to Inform Authorities Regarding Child Abuse</h2>
            <p>On March 25th 2025 Paul Hammond told teaching staff that a teacher had been accused of physically assaulting a student and that the relevant CCTV video was given to the police. This legal investigation proves that Paul Hammond's statement were false. The supposed accusation was made on 20 March 2025 and Paul Hammond allowed this teacher to continue teaching for a full three days afterward. He was not relieved of duties until after classes on Friday, further endangering children.</p>
